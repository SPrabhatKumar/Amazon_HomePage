# Amazon_HomePage
I have recently completed my first HTML and CSS project, which is a clone of the home page of Amazon.com, a popular e-commerce website. As a beginner in HTML and CSS, this project has been an excellent learning experience for me to practice and improve my skills. Despite being a beginner, I have strived to ensure the code is clean, well-commented, and follows best practices. I am eager to contribute my project to GitHub to showcase my progress and invite feedback from the community to further enhance my skills in web development.
